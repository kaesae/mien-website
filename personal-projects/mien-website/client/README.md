# Project: Mienglish 
A Mien dictionary with English words, part of speech, and examples to help English users learn Mien.

## Overview
This project serves as a passion project tying in my current skills as a full stack software engineer and my cultural identity as Mien.

## Ideas
- Move data from JSON to SQL database
- Recreate Mien crosstitch patterns on PC using graph, X's and O's, or in Illustrator
- On the left side of Dictionary have a word search, on the right side have a sound search OR, right side automatically populates all the sounds of a word that's clicked on, follows you (sticky/fixed) on page (down the line, click on any Mien word and it will populate sounds on right side)
- Category of words (Anatomy, sports, cooking, computer, house, colors)
- AAC board with IPA switch for encoding input
